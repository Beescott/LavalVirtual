LavalVirtual

Laval Virtual is one of the biggest technologies gathering about Virtual Reality.
Each year, they organize a 30-hours hackathon where the subject is disclosed at the beginning of the contest.

This year's subject was : "Handicap and immersive technology : a new connection to the world".
My team and I decided to implement an interface that would allow certain disabled people to have access to virtual reality.

Today, the UX in VR revolves around actionning buttons : for example, to grab an object you have to get your hand
close enough and then you grab it by pushing a button on the controller.
People with motricity deficiency in their hands and amputees can't use VR in this configuration.

That's why we decided to re-think the entire UX. We ranked 3rd upon 12 teams.

Here is a presentation video of what we did : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dmXaXzVbMJlwStyWr7fbjt1PwvCyevdQ/view?usp=sharing
